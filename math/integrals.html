                <p>An integral is a method of calculating the sum of an infinite series. What does that mean? Well it means we are going to repeat the same equation as many times as we can and then add together the results of each iteration. Below we have pictured a common function that uses an integral called the gamma function.</p>

Z here refers to the number that we are passing to our function. The weird 'R' means anything we pass has to have a real part greater than 0. We are going to have an interval here represented by dt. Each time we loop through the equation we are going to increase the value of t which starts at the number at the bottom of the integral sign until it gets to the number at the top of the integral sign. We will increase it by dt. The letter e is Eulerâ€™s number. We are then going to sum all of our results. We obviously cannot actually count to infinity as this equation asks. That means we are never going to get the actual answer but we can get close rather quickly. Here is a very simple chart showing a line converging towards the answer for g(4) the more iterations we go through.</p>
