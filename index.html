            <h2>Andrew Gossage</h2>
            <p>I am originally from Los Angeles originally but grew up in a farm town
            in a more rural part of California. I now live in Orem Utah with my
            wife and our three children. We are celebrating our anniversary this
            week. I work as a data scientist and full stack developer. As a fun 
            fact about myself I speak Bulgarian (from my mission), Russian, 
            French and I have studied some others that I haven't kept up as well.
                I love to hike in the mountains around where I live and I also enjoy 
                the occasional attempt at fishing. </p>
